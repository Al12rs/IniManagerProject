# INI Manager

### What is INI Manager?
It's a descktop application that aims to offer a way to manage changes to .ini configuration files. 
A change to an ini file is made of a set of keys and values either adder or modified in relation to the original version of the file.
With INIM these changes are stored in isolated enteties called Edits. Each edit has a priority of application and an enabled state.
INIM then allows the user to Merge together all the Edits into a Merge Result.
This way change to the Base File can be toggled at any time, in addition if two Edits change the same keys, the Edits priority can be changed by dragging them up or down on the list, allowing users the ability to decide how to resolve conflicts independetly from the order in which the Edits where created.

### Features:
* Manage multiple documents at the same time through tabs.
* Text editor to modify contens of Edits, Base File and Managed .ini file.
* Profiles that contain order and status of Edits to quicly obtain different configurations of the final file.

### Contributing:
INIM was developed as part of a University Software Engineering project, but it has been released under GPL3 licence so that it's developent can continue even after the completition of the project. 
Any contribution is greatly appreciated.
